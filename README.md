# Job-Training-Impact-Analysis

This repository demonstrates the application of causal inference techniques using the DoubleML library to analyze the impact of a job training program on future earnings. Using the LaLonde dataset, a benchmark in causal inference literature, we showcase:
- Data preparation and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of Double Machine Learning methods (Partial Linear Regression and Interactive Regression Model)
- Comparison with naive estimation and OLS regression
- Heterogeneous treatment effect analysis
- Sensitivity analysis and propensity score evaluation
- Comprehensive result interpretation
